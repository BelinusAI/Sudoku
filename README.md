# Sudoku
Program to solve Sudoku puzzles using backtracking recursive structure.

I representing the board as a list of lists, each grid cell holding an assigned digit. I use the digit 0 to indicate that a cell has not yet been filled. The solution to a Sudoku puzzle is just such a grid, but one in which no 0 entries remain and all the constraints are satisfied.
